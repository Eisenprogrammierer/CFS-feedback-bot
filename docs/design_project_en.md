# Feedback Bot Project

## I. Goals and Objectives

### Main Goal
Automate the handling of incoming inquiries from customers and users to reduce the workload on the support team.

### Specific Tasks
- **Classification of Inquiries**: Determine the type of request (question, partnership proposal, order, error/vulnerability report, product review, feature request).
- **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Responses**: Provide instant answers to common questions.
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Assist in identifying the causes of issues and provide solutions.
- **Information Collection**: Request necessary information from the user to resolve the issue.
- **Escalation to Human Agents**: Forward complex or sensitive inquiries to support operators.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the emotional state of the user to tailor responses.
- **Feedback-Driven Learning**: Collect and analyze feedback to improve response quality and AI agent performance.
- **Multilingual Support**: Russian, German, Italian, and English.

## II. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Rust.
- **Telegram Bot API**.
- **AI Agent**: Llama-3.
  - **Inference Engine**: Local execution with optimization, quantization, possibly distillation, and llama.cpp.
  - **Fine-tuning**: Combination of generated and open data for training using QLoRA methodology.
  - **Prompt Engineering**: Development of effective prompts to elicit desired responses from Llama-3.
- **Database**: SQLite.
- **Logging System**.
- **Monitoring System**.

## III. Design and Architecture

- **Modular Architecture**.
- **Asynchronous Processing**.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
  - **Intent Recognition**: Identify the user's intention (e.g., "I want to change my password," "I have a payment issue").
  - **Entity Extraction**: Extract key entities from messages (e.g., order number, username, product version).
- **Dialogue Management**:
  - **State Management**: Track the current state of the dialogue with the user.
  - **Turn-based Interaction**: Ensure sequential interaction with the user.
- **User Interface**:
  - **Buttons and Inline Keyboards**: For convenient bot interaction.
  - **Forms**: For collecting information from users.

## IV. Training and Supporting the AI Agent

- **Data Collection for Llama-3 Training**:
  - History of support inquiries.
  - Product documentation.
  - FAQ.
  - Conversations with real users (with their consent).
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format data for training.
- **Fine-tuning Llama-3**: Train the model on collected data.
- **Evaluation and Monitoring**: Assess the quality of the AI agent's performance and monitor its performance.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously improve the model based on feedback and new data.

## V. Integration with Existing Systems

- **CRM**: Integrate with our CRM system to access customer information and save inquiry history.
- **Knowledge Base**: Integrate with the knowledge base to provide up-to-date information to users.
- **Project Management System**: Integrate with the project management system to create tasks and track progress.

## VI. Security

- **SQL Injection Protection**.
- **XSS Attack Protection**.
- **Secure Data Storage**: Protect user personal data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Restrict access to bot functionality.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests from a single user to prevent abuse.

## VII. Task Prioritization

- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
  1. Automate FAQ responses for customers.
  2. Classify customer inquiries.
  3. Automate information collection from customers.
- **Iterative Approach**: Develop and implement features iteratively, gather user feedback, and improve the bot based on this feedback.

## VIII. Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Response Time**: Average time for the bot to respond to user queries.
- **Number of Handled Inquiries**: Number of inquiries processed by the bot.
- **Percentage of Resolved Inquiries**: Percentage of inquiries resolved by the bot without human intervention.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: User satisfaction with the bot's performance (e.g., through surveys).

### Additional Metrics
- **Number of Escalations**: Number of inquiries forwarded to support operators.
- **Support Operator Workload**: Reduction in the workload of support operators.
- **Classification Accuracy**: Accuracy of inquiry classification.
- **Information Extraction Accuracy**: Accuracy of extracting key entities from messages.

### Monitoring System
Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track these metrics in real-time.
