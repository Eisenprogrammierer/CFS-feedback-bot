- **Responses to FAQ**: Provide instant answers to common questions.
- **Problem Diagnosis**: Assist in identifying the causes of issues and provide solutions.
- **Information Collection**: Request necessary information from the user.
- **Escalation to Human Agents**: Forward complex or sensitive inquiries to support operators.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the emotional state of the user.
- **Feedback-Driven Learning**: Collect and analyze feedback to improve response quality.
- **Multilingual Support**: Russian, German, Italian, and English.

### 2.3. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The bot should process requests within a few seconds.
- **Scalability**: The system should be scalable to handle increased load.
- **Security**: Protect data and prevent attacks.
- **User Interface**: The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.

## 3. Architecture and Design

### 3.1. Overall Architecture
- **Modular Architecture**: The system should be divided into modules for easy maintenance and expansion.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use asynchronous calls to improve performance.
- **User Interface**: Use buttons and inline keyboards for convenient interaction.

### 3.2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Intent Recognition**: Identify the user's intention.
- **Entity Extraction**: Extract key entities from messages.

### 3.3. Dialogue Management
- **State Management**: Track the current state of the dialogue.
- **Turn-based Interaction**: Ensure sequential interaction with the user.

## 4. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Rust.
- **Telegram Bot API**.
- **AI Agent**: Llama-3.
  - **Inference Engine**: Local execution with optimization, quantization, possibly distillation, and llama.cpp.
  - **Fine-tuning**: Combination of generated and open data for training using QLoRA methodology.
  - **Prompt Engineering**: Develop effective prompts.
- **Database**: SQLite.
- **Logging System**.
- **Monitoring System**.

## 5. Training and Supporting the AI Agent

- **Data Collection**: History of support inquiries, documentation, FAQ, conversations with users.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format data.
- **Fine-tuning**: Train the model on collected data.
- **Evaluation and Monitoring**: Assess the quality of the AI agent's performance.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Continuously improve the model based on feedback.

## 6. Integration with Existing Systems

- **CRM**: Integrate with the CRM system to access customer information.
- **Knowledge Base**: Integrate with the knowledge base to provide up-to-date information.
- **Project Management System**: Integrate with the project management system to create tasks.

## 7. Security

- **SQL Injection Protection**.
- **XSS Attack Protection**.
- **Secure Data Storage**.
- **Authentication and Authorization**.
- **Rate Limiting**.

## 8. Task Prioritization

- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
  1. Automate FAQ responses.
  2. Classify inquiries.
  3. Automate information collection.

- **Iterative Approach**: Develop and implement features iteratively, gather user feedback, and improve the bot based on this feedback.

## 9. Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Response Time**: Average time for the bot to respond to user queries.
- **Number of Handled Inquiries**: Number of inquiries processed by the bot.
- **Percentage of Resolved Inquiries**: Percentage of inquiries resolved by the bot without human intervention.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: User satisfaction with the bot's performance.

### Additional Metrics
- **Number of Escalations**: Number of inquiries forwarded to support operators.
- **Support Operator Workload**: Reduction in the workload of support operators.
- **Classification Accuracy**: Accuracy of inquiry classification.
- **Information Extraction Accuracy**: Accuracy of extracting key entities from messages.

### Monitoring System
Use a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track metrics in real-time.
